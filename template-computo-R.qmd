  This document provides a template based on the [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) system for contributions to Computo, using the [`quarto journal extension`](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension), the knitr kernel (R user) and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to set-up the dependencies.

# Introduction

## About this document

This document, accompanied with the [hopefully finely tuned git repos](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R/), provides a template for writing contributions to **Computo** [@computo]. We show how `R` code [@R-base] can be included and how the repository can be set up for triggering github actions for rendering the document, with dependencies handled by `renv`.

## Setup a github repository for preparing your submission

You can start by clicking the "use this template" button, on the top of the page of the [github repository associated to this document](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R/). Of course, you can set your repository private during the preparation of your manuscript.

## Quarto

You need [quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed on your system and the [Computo extension](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension) to prepare your document. For the latter, once quarto is installed,  run the following to install the extension in the current directory (it creates a `_extension` directory which is ignored by git thanks to `.gitignore` by default):

```.bash
quarto add computorg/computo-quarto-extension
```

# Formatting

This section covers basic formatting guidelines for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a versatile formatting system for authoring document integrating markdown, LaTeX and various code block interpreted either via Jupyter or Knitr (and thus dealing with Python, R or Julia). It relies on the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) document converter.

To render a document, run `quarto render`. By default, both PDF and HTML documents are generated:

```.bash
quarto render template-computo-R.qmd # will render both to html and PDF
```

## Note

To check the syntax of the formatting below, you can use the `</> source` button at the top left of this document.

## Basic markdown formatting

**Bold text** or _italic_

- This is a list
- With more elements
- It isn't numbered.

But we can also do a numbered list

1. This is my first item
2. This is my second item
3. This is my third item

## Mathematics

### Mathematical formulae

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) code is natively supported[^lualatex], which makes it possible to use mathematical formulae:

[^lualatex]: We use [lualatex](https://lualatex.org/) for this purpose.

$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) =
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \mu)^2\right)}
$$

It is also posible to cross-reference an equation, see @eq-mylabel:

$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{x_N} & = \frac12
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
x_L^\top & x_N^\top \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{cc}  L_L & B \\ B^\top & L_N \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_L \\ x_N \end{array}\right] \\
& = \frac12 (x_L^\top L_L x_L + 2 x_N^\top B^\top x_L + x_N^\top L_N x_N),
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mylabel}

### Theorems and other amsthem-like environments

Quarto includes a nice support for theorems, with predefined prefix labels for theorems, lemmas, proposition, etc. see [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs). Here is a simple example:

::: {#thm-slln}
## Strong law of large numbers

The sample average converges almost surely to the expected value:

$$\overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.$$
:::

See @thm-slln.

## R Code

Quarto uses either Jupyter or knitr to render code chunks. This can be triggered in the yaml header. In this tutorial, we use `knitr`, (`R`, `knitr` and `markdown` must be installed on your computer)

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author "Jane Doe"
---
```

`R` code [@R-base] chunks may be embedded as follows:

```{r r-code, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(10)
```

## Figures

Plots can be generated as follows:

```{r pressure, message = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
p
```

It is also possible to create figures from static images:

:::{#fig-logo}

## Tables

Tables (with label: `@tbl-mylabel` renders @tbl-mylabel) can be generated with markdown as follows

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
: my table caption {#tbl-mylabel}

Table can also be generated by some code, for instance with knitr here:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption = "Table caption.")
```

## Handling references {#sec-references}

### Bibliographic references

References are displayed as footnotes using
[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/), e.g. `[@computo]` will be displayed
as [@computo], where `computo` is the bibtex key for this specific
entry. The bibliographic information is automatically retrieved from
the `.bib` file specified in the header of this document (here:
`references.bib`).

### Other cross-references

As already (partially) seen, Quarto includes a mechanism similar to the
bibliographic references for sections, equations, theorems, figures,
lists, etc. Have a look at [this
page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

## Advanced formatting

Advanced formatting features are possible and documented (including interactive plots, pseudo-code, (Tikz) diagrams, Lua filters, mixing R + Python in the same document), but are beyond the scope of this simple introduction. We point several entries in this direction.

# Finalize your submission

## Handle `R` dependencies with `renv`

To make your work reproducible, you need to fix the packages and environment used to run your analysis. For the `R` system, the `renv` package is one of the possible reliable method, supported by the community. You basically need a couple of commands to setup your environment on your local machine. First,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renv::init()
```

will initialize your repository. Then you just need to install the dependencies required to run your contribution, for instance, 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
renv::install("ggplot2") # or equivalently install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Non-CRAN packages (*e.g.* Github packages) can be used. Once you are done, you can fix everything with the command

```{r, eval=FALSE}
renv::snapshot()
```

The only file that needs to be versioned by git is `renv.lock`. By default, the rest is ignored thanks to `.gitignore`. More details for using `renv` can be found either

- on the [`renv` packge webpage](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), or
- on the [quarto page dedicated to environments](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#using-renv)

## Continuous integration

The repository associated with this template is pre-configure to trigger an action on push that performs the following:

1. Check out repository on the `ubuntu-latest` machine
2. Install quarto and dependencies, including the Computo extension
3. Install R and dependencies with `renv`, using your `renv.lock` file
4. Render your .qmd file and Publish the results on a gh-page (both HTML and PDF)

The file [.github/workflows/build_n_publish.yml](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_n_publish.yml) is largely inspired from [this file](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#example-knitr-with-renv).

Once this is successful, you are ready to submit your manuscript to the [Computo submission platform](https://computo.scholasticahq.com/).
