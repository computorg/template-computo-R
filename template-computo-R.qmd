  This document provides a template based on the quarto system for contributions to Computo, using the journal extension, the knitr kernel (R user) and `renv` to set-up the dependencies.

# Introduction

## About this document

This document provides a template based on the [quarto system](https://quarto.org/) for contributions to **Computo** @computo. We show how `R` [@R-base] code can be included and how the repository can be set-up for triggering github-action with `renv`.

## Advice for writting your manuscript

First make sure that you are able to build your manuscript as a regular notebook on your system.

# Formatting

This section covers basic formatting guidelines. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a versatile  formatting system for authoring HTML based on markdown, integrating LaTeX and various code block interpreted either via Jupyter or Knitr (and thus deal with Python, R and many other langages). It relies on the [Pandoc Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html) markup language.

To render/compile a document, run `quarto render`. A document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded code chunks within the document:

``` .bash
quarto render template-computo-R.qmd # will render both to html and PDF
```

## Basic markdown formatting

**Bold text** or _italic_

- This is a list
- With more elements
- It isn't numbered.

But we can also do a numbered list

1. This is my first item
2. This is my second item
3. This is my third item

## Mathematics

### Mathematical formulae

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) code is natively supported[^katex], which makes it possible to use mathematical formulae:

[^katex]: We use [katex](https://katex.org/) for this purpose.

will render

$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) =
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \mu)^2\right)}
$$

It is also posible to cross-reference an equation, see @eq-mylabel:

$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{x_N} & = \frac12
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
x_L^\top & x_N^\top \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{cc}  L_L & B \\ B^\top & L_N \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_L \\ x_N \end{array}\right] \\
& = \frac12 (x_L^\top L_L x_L + 2 x_N^\top B^\top x_L + x_N^\top L_N x_N),
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mylabel}

### Theorems and other amsthem-like environments

Quarto includes a nice support for theorems, with predefined prefix labels for theorems, lemmas, proposition, etc. see [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs). Here is a simple example:

::: {#thm-slln}
## Strong law of large numbers

The sample average converges almost surely to the expected value:

$$\overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.$$
:::

See @thm-slln.

## Code

Quarto uses either Jupyter or knitr to render code chunks. This can be triggered in the yaml header, e.g., for Jupyter (should be installed on your computer) use

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author "Jane Doe"
jupyter: python3
---
```

For knitr (R + knitr must be installed on your computer)

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author "Jane Doe"
---
```

You can use Jupyter for Python code and more. And R + KnitR for if you want to mix R with Python (via the package reticulate @R-reticulate).

### R

`R` code [@R-base] chunks may be embedded as follows:

```{r r-code, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(10)
```

## Figures

Plots can be generated as follows:

```{r pressure, message = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
p
```

It is also possible to create figures from static images:

:::{#fig-logo}

## Tables

Tables (with label: `@tbl-mylabel` renders @tbl-mylabel) can be generated with markdown as follows

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
: my table caption {#tbl-mylabel}

Table can also be generated by some code, for instance with knitr here:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption = "Table caption.")
```

## Handling references {#sec-references}

### Bibliographic references

References are displayed as footnotes using
[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/), e.g. `[@computo]` will be displayed
as [@computo], where `computo` is the bibtex key for this specific
entry. The bibliographic information is automatically retrieved from
the `.bib` file specified in the header of this document (here:
`references.bib`).

### Other cross-references

As already (partially) seen, Quarto includes a mecanism similar to the
bibliographic references for sections, equations, theorems, figures,
lists, etc. Have a look at [this
page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

## For more information

- [The template available in the Computo Quarto extension  ](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/published-paper-tsne/) uses advanced features and the KnitR kernel (interactive plots and pseudocode).

- [Check our mock version of the t-SNE paper](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/published-paper-tsne/) for a full and advanced example using the Jupyter kernel.

- Also look at the previously published paper in Computo for even advanced examples.
